## Description
This docker container host a cups installation based on ubuntu:xenial.

It includes the driver for the Panasonic KX-MB2130G and a cups configuration for this printer.

The motivation for this container was due to two facts:
- the Windows driver doesn't work on Windows 11 any longer, due to problems with the driver signing.
- Android devices are not capable of using the printer with the Windows driver.

Both points are solved with this driver distribution.

The current version can be pulled from [hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/darkmessiah/ubuntu/general):

```shell
docker pull darkmessiah/ubuntu:qus1
```

## Container Execution

To run this container, the cups port 631 has to be exposed:

```shell
docker run -p "631:631" darkmessiah/ubuntu:qus1
```

You can also use docker-compose to run with the attached docker-compose.yml file:

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

### Note

Since this image is x86_64 only due to the driver binaries, it can't be run on other architectures.
However there is a possibility to run it on a RaspberryPi 4 linux/arm/v7 with the help of qemu.

To do so, you need to install the qemu user files and register them for the image target architecture x86_64:

```shell
sudo docker run --rm --privileged aptman/qus:d7.2 -s -- -p x86_64
```

As now now it worked with the LATEST version tag d7.2.
With earlier version a saw segmentation faults/dumps due to errors in the binary cups filter.
This seems to be fixed now. 

I tested it on "Docker version 23.0.4, build f480fb1"

When you now run the image, it gives you a warning:

```shell
WARNING: The requested image's platform (linux/amd64) does not match the detected host platform (linux/arm/v7) and no specific platform was requested
```

Once you step into the container:

```shell
pi@raspberrypi:~/docker $ docker exec -it c8f4f46c83b3 bash
```

You can see, that the binaries are not executed directly, but with the qemu-x86_64-static

```shell
root@c8f4f46c83b3:/# ps -ef
UID        PID  PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD

```
